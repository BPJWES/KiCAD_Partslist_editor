## Notes by Karl
* fix bug with missing footprint and value fields in the CSV export
* add unit-counter to component
* add warnings, if footprint and/or value for one components is different between the units

* see other TODOs marked in the code with TODO <N> with N from 0 = very important to 5 = would be nice if implemented
