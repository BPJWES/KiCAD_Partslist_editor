--- Installing KiCad Partslist-editor:

Running KiCad Partslist-editor using windows, requires Python 3 and the TKinter.

On linux you have to install python3 and python3-tk with 
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-tk
Then you can run the part list editor with 
python3 SCH_TO_CSV_OOP.py



--- Using KiCad Partslist-editor:

The Open File button, allows one to open the kicad .sch files, which subsequently parses the selected schematic file and all its hierarchical daughter modules.

Hitting the generate CSV button will allow you to save a .CSV file containing the parsed contents of the schematic files.

List Parts, shows the parts of the opened schematic in the GUI.

Sort Parts will sort the parts list in alphabetic order.

The LoadCSV button lets you select the csv file containing the the partslist as generated by KiCad PLE including the edits as made by the user using an external program.

The SaveNewSCH updates the schematic files with the updated information as loaded through the LoadCSV operation.

CleanMemory is quite self explanatory.



--- Advanced use:
To change the fields that the KiCAD PLE imports, exports and edits, edit the FieldKeywords.conf file

The syntax of the FieldKeywords.conf file is:
First line is version string, this should not be changed
Lastline is end-of-file indicator

All lines starting with "<" define a field KiCAD PLE will look for in .SCH files

The syntax of such a line is as follows:

<Fieldname|Field_alias1|Field_alias2|Field_alias3>

The Fieldname is the primary alias, so it can be considered Field_alias0 as well.

The amount of aliases which can be added is theoretically unlimited, but the minimum is 1 (i.e. the field name)
