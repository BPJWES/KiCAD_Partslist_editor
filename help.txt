To change the fields that the KiCAD PLE imports, exports and edits, edit the FieldKeywords.conf file

The syntax of the FieldKeywords.conf file is:
First line is version string, this should not be changed
Lastline is end-of-file indicator

All lines starting with "<" define a field KiCAD PLE will look for in .SCH files

The syntax of such a line is as follows:

<Fieldname|Field_alias1|Field_alias2|Field_alias3>

The Fieldname is the primary alias, so it can be considered Field_alias0 as well.

The amount of aliases which can be added is theoretically unlimited, but the minimum is 1 (i.e. the field name)
